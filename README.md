# Project: Algorithm Visualization

## Description
This project is a web application I built using React, TypeScript, and React Router, with the primary aim of visualizing various algorithms through animations to facilitate a better understanding of their workings. The project is designed for desktop use only.

## Technology Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- React Router

## Interesting Features
- I implemented fundamental algorithms like a stack, queue, and linked list using classes.
- Special attention has been paid to React rendering to create animations that visually represent algorithm behavior based on the given technical specifications.
- The project incorporates caching of recursive calls within a loop in a sorting method to optimize performance.
- Functions used in the linked list are well-documented to aid other developers in understanding the code.
- Throughout the project's development, I followed an iterative approach to thematic commits, resulting in a more organized development history.

I hope this project proves to be valuable for those interested in algorithm visualization and learning how algorithms work.
